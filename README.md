# Overview

In this challenge, we use MongoDB as a database for the scraped data then this data is translated to our website. We do this by using a scrapping script to withdraw this data, as well as an app script to interact with MongoDB. We use a web application to display the data and alter it accordingly. This provides basic data such as facts and images. The data is scrapped alongside a button created with HTML and source references. We used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape images of Mars' hemispheres and their respective titles.
