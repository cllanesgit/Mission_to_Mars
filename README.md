# Overview

In this challenge, we use MongoDB as a database for the scraped data then this data is then translated to our website. We do this by using a scrapping script to withdraw this data, as well as an app script to interact with MongoDB. This provides basic data such as facts and images. The data is scrapped alongside a button created with HTML and source references.
